Orley Ashenfelter en Princeton økonom udviklede i 1980’erne en statistik model til forudsigelse af vinpriser baseret på nedbør, solskinstimer og andre klimadata. Hele den etablerede vinverden var i oprør, ved en præsentation i Christie’s vinafdeling, blev han buhet ud. Robert Parker den verdenskendte vinkender udtalte “Det svarer til en filmanmelder der ikke ser filmen, men udelukkende baserer sin anmeldelse på instruktøren og skuespilleren”. Orley udtalte, lang tid før det var muligt for vinseksperterne, at 1989 Bordeux ville blive århundredets vin, uanset den kun havde ligget 3 måneder på fade. Flere analyser har siden vist Orleys model er langt mere præcis eksperterne. Meget få vinkendere har anerkendt kvaliteten af Orleys model, men deres forecasts ligger nu langt tættere på modellens forudsigelser.</p>

<p>Min gode ven Benjamin Tejlbjerg har lavet en super hjemmeside med gymnasie matematik og statistik <a href="http://www.mathhx.dk/?q=node/117">http://www.mathhx.dk</a>. Siden er gratis og god til at genopfriske basisbegreber indenfor statistik, vi kommer ikke i dybden med disse begreber her.</p>
<p>For at få et overblik over hypoteserne for de forskellige tests kan man hente et hypotese mindmap, der er mindmaps til flere forskellige uddannelser under materialer. Her er hypoteseoversigten for finansøkonomer: <a href="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=0B1E7VnhxsDMlQ1Zhdjh5WTJ4bnM">CPH Finansøkonom statistik mindmap</a></p>

<p>Bankerne sammensætter investeringsporteføljer, der minimerer risikoen (variansen), ved aktiver der har lav eller negativ samvariation (kovarians). Cykliske aktier som FL Smidth har fx. lav samvariation med en ikke cyklisk aktie som Novo.</p>
<p>Forsikringsselskaberne beregner præmier for forsikringstageren, baseret på statistike sandsynligheder for at en hændelse indtræffer. Modellerne kan være meget specifikke, en indboforsikring kan fx. være baseret på ikke bare postnummer, boligform, men også etage, uddannelsesniveau etc.</p>
<p>Finansielle virksomheder underlagt finanstilsynet, bruger modeller til beregning af risiko baseret på statistisk analyse.</p>
<p>Mægleren beregner udbudspriser, udfra en multipel lineær regressionsmodel, der indeholder variable som størrelse, energimærke, tagtype etc.</p>
